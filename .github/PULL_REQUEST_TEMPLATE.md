Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above. Do not include any task numbers.
Use imperative, present tense capitalizing the first letter: "Change" not "Changed" nor "changes". This will become a correct final merge commit message ðŸ˜„

The imperative tells someone what merging the PR **will do**, rather than **what you did**.

Example: "Refactor code for readability".
